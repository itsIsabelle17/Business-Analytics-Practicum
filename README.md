# Business-Analytics-Practicum
This graduation project involves becoming a student consultant to solve a company's problem. As a Marketing Data Analyst, I tracked and evaluated the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and creatives. I also provided strategies to optimize advertising spending for a real-world fintech startup, focusing on providing air cover support for sales.
